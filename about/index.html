    <p>
      Since 2017, GLITCHLETTE has been the sonic moniker of Autumn Marceau, a producer, songwriter, and vocalist based in Seattle, WA. GLITCHLETTE crafts cinematic, beat-driven songs that swing between tender ballads and explosive breakdowns, lush dirges and mosh-pit anthems punctuated by ethereal vocals both soft and belted. After teaching herself electronic production from the ground up, she released her debut EP 
      <a href="https://glitchlette.bandcamp.com/album/subsoil" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SUBSOIL</a> in 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2020, Marceau collaborated with Default Genders on the remix album <em>Pain Mop Girl</em>, adding vocals and additional production to the song

    </p>
    <p>
      Her latest work, titled  
      <strong>EVERY RAT WANTS TO CRAWL IN YOUR MOUTH AND CLEAN YOUR TEETH!</strong>, is set to release in September 2025. Written between September 2019 and May 2020,  
      <strong>EVERY RAT</strong> is a short collection of diary entries inspired by <em>House of Leaves</em>, two breakups, the film <em>Mandy</em>, and manic episodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Built around irregular song structures and progressive arcs,  
      <strong>EVERY RAT</strong> borrows the language of cinema: tension and release, tonal shifts, and emotional swells more akin to scene changes than traditional pop structure. Though softer in sound than a typical slasher soundtrack, <strong>EVERY RAT</strong> carries the emotional viscera and ethos of psychological horror: the monster is never seen, only felt.
