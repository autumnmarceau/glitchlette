This is how my creative director Jaz and I shot the cover for the latest GLITCHLETTE EP [EVERY RAY WANTS TO CRAWL IN YOUR MOUTH AND CLEAN YOUR TEETH!](/music) and how we almost didn't live to tell the tale. (Like, seriously.)

## Dear David Lynch, I Get It Now

Back in February, Jaz and I drove to Long Beach, WA for a photo shoot. The journey from Seattle is about 3.5 hours. Once you get off I-5, the landscape unfurls into the familiar eeriness that pervades Washington’s most rural areas. Winding roads cut through misty lowlands, old-growth forests, and drowsy logging towns that straddle the seams of here and *there*; Places with no tourists, only outsiders. 

Here, it feels like every tree portends your doom. It's easy to see why David Lynch chose this region for *Twin Peaks.* 

We stopped for gas in Montesano, pulling into an unassuming Chevron adjacent to a small motel-turned-shopping complex. The buildings felt especially unnatural among the verdant stillness of the hillside, as if they weren't meant to be there and  *you* certainly weren't meant to see them. 

Across from the gas station was a small consignment shop, with no signage or branding but a big “OPEN” sign. We’d been wanting to find some weapon or prop for the shoot, so we took a look before hitting the road again. Our only criteria was that the weapon looked "cursed". Be careful what you wish for.

## The Axe from The Shop With No Name


The shop was a hazardous shrine to chaos. Old dolls with barren eyes stared blankly across from gun racks. A sideways refrigerator box housed a *pit* of antlers and animal bones, serving as overflow for the dozens that hung from the ceiling. Tetanus was a constant threat, with rusty chainsaws and garden tools from various centuries enclosing the narrow aisles. Any remaining wall space not used for product display was filled with a mix of the rare and mundane. Vintage Elvis figurines next to singing fish.


Among the weapons and tools was what I would lovingly describe as an *abundant* selection of axes, precariously propped against the wall, blades out, like a domino line of mini-guillotines for klutzy toes. There was one that drew my eye, with a bright red head, sturdy handle, and a suitable amount of wear and tear for authenticity. Jaz and I agreed. 

#### "That's the one."


As we checked out, we made casual conversation with the elderly married couple who owned the place. They seemed like an ordinary couple, eccentric only in their complete unawareness of the gonzo shopping experience they’d curated.

They were *very* excited that I was buying the axe, telling me how it was new to their inventory, having just been brought in a few days prior by ‘some guy’. I zoned out the details as I perused the stickers at the counter,  that said “BIG FOOT IS REAL AND I HELPED HIM COMMIT TAX FRAUD,” which I popped on my laptop. (Maybe you'll see it at the next [show?](/shows))


We mentioned we’d be passing through town again the next day, and they encouraged us to stop by and chimed, "we'll be here!" 

The woman laughed as she handed me the receipt. “Our business name isn’t even on here!” We gave it no thought.  

As we pulled away, I opened Google Maps to mark the spot so we could find our way back the next day.

We named the axe Shelley (after Shelley Duvall, of course. RIP <3).

## The Shoot at Long Beach


We arrived in Long Beach,checked into our hotel, and started prepping for the shoot. We started outside Marsh’s Free Museum, home to [Jake the Alligator Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_the_Alligator_Man) and half of our reason for coming. The lighting used to be a mix of candy-colored LEDs and neon signs, but they must have dialed it down in  back. (Totally rude of them to compromise our artistic vision). We still got some [cool shots](/photos/antique_axe_filtered.jpg), but the main event was next: *shooting on the beach*.

</figure>

Long Beach is cool because in the winter, you’re allowed to drive directly onto the sand. So we did, parking about 50 feet from the shore, which we assumed was a safe distance. The tide was out, and it would stay that way. 

The shoot itself oscillated between fun and suffering. I mean, look at me, I was wearing pleather and a dress made of tissue paper. Our only light sources were the car’s headlights and a tiny 6x3-inch lightbox Jaz brought along.

In between takes, I huddled in the ghost hoodie to stay warm, which is how we got the thumbnail photo.

We rolled onto the beach around 11PM. The weather was *awful*. Low 40s, with brash gusts of wind and sheets of rain pouring sideways. My weather app showed a **gale warning advisory**, but we figured we could ignore it since we weren’t planning on getting on a boat or going swimming.

In hindsight, a bad call.

Most of the photos were unusable thanks to my frigid posture and shivering jaw. My non-prescription sclera lenses and LED headlights blasting into my periphery robbed me of sight. 

If I look terrified in the photo, it's because I was. In the moment the album cover was taken, I caught a glimpse of another cars headlights rapidly approaching us. They quickly turned to exit the shore, but I spent a solid 10 seconds thinking I was about to get flattened. 


## Never Turn Your Back On The Ocean

After the shoot, we got back in the car and I tried my best to talk through labored exhales and chattering teeth. I put my glasses on, finally able to see clearly for the first time in hours, and looked ahead.

#### "Hey, is it just me or is the water getting closer?"

It was.

*Very fast.*

As the wall of water rushed towards us, I yelled, “GO GO GO GO GO.” Jaz slammed the gas, and flipped a U, spiriting us away from the incoming wave *just in time.*
We didn’t stop to look back, heading straight for the hotel, erupting into maniacal, adrenaline-fueled laughter once we entered our room. I opened the weather app again to re-check the gale warning… and saw something I had missed before:


 SLEEPER WAVE WARNING!

Whoops. My bad. 


### What is a Sleeper Wave?
>Sleeper (or sneaker) waves are unpredictable surges that can rush up to 150 feet beyond the waterline without warning. Cold, fast, and violent, they can knock people down or drag cars into the sea. The typically safety adage is: **Never turn your back on the ocean.**

A quick search showed it only takes a foot of rushing water to make Jaz's tiny sedan float, and what we narrowly escaped began to sink in.

#### "These photos better be damn good!"

Neither of us slept that night. Since then, we’ve developed a healthy fear *and* reverent fascination with the ocean. She’s our God now. She let us live. Honestly, I should probably dedicate the album to her.


## The Uncanny Mystery of Shelley the Axe


On our way back, we followed through on our promise to the old couple and stopped at the same Chevron for gas, hoping to see what else we could find at the Shop with No Name.

The shop was closed, blinds pulled, obscuring what was (or wasn't) inside. 

"Didn't they say they'd be open today?" Jaz asked. 

I pulled up the pin I’d dropped on Google Maps to check their hours. The business wasn't even registered as a consignment shop, but a permanently closed nail salon.

The Shop with No Name was actually the Shop That Didn't Exist. 

It hit us that the whole experience may have been some kind of curse. The axe, mysterious in origin, came from a place that per any public record, did not exist. While in our possession, we almost died. Granted, our chances of being taken out by a sleeper wave were the same without the axe, but whose to say its infernal aura didn't contribute. 

Whether the poltergeist plotted our demise or protected us from it is TBD. We're terrified to get rid of the axe either way. It currently lives in the trunk of Jaz's car, for safekeeping. 


## Life Imitates Art

  <br><figcaption>Totally worth it. That photo is unsettling as fuck, which was the goal.</figcaption>
</figure>

I've seen around [160 horror movies](https://letterboxd.com/hailsagan666/list/horror-ive-seen/) (a shamefully conversative number, IMO). In hindsight, we comically played into the tropes in some of my favorite slashers. I imagined watching myself on screen, fruitlessly pleading "Listen to the old man!" "Read the warning signs!" "NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON THE OCEAN!". 

The goal for the shoot was rooted in one murky vision: the [final girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_girl) becomes the killer, and while we certainly nailed it I think we did it a little too well 

**ALL HAIL THE OCEAN. ALL HAIL SHELLEY THE AXE**
