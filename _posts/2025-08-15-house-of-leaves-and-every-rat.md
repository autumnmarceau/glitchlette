I'm glad House of Leaves has gained more traction in recent years, thanks to TikTok. It's one of my favorite books, and has served as artistic inspiration many times throughout the course of GLITCHLETTE, especially on my recent EP, [**EVERY RAY WANTS TO CRAWL IN YOUR MOUTH AND CLEAN YOUR TEETH!**](/music). 

In fact, it shows up in the first track, WRAITH SPACE: 

>"Not yet nor vain wraiths or quaint ghosts constrained thy chariot to go backwards such as that, they say, in diverse places. The wraiths walk of ghosts dying or dead."

This quote is actually from an obscure translation of The Aeneid that shows up in HOL's labryinth of footnotes. When I read that quote, it was so lyrically beautiful it compelled me to open my laptop and make something. That something wound up being WRAITH SPACE.

I'll be the first one to say, that song is a progeny of vibes and vibes alone. And, even though it's the intro to the EP, it was actually the last song I wrote for it. 

HOL's influence shows up again on the third track, Hard Thoughts. 

This time it's an Emily Dickinson poem, which if memory serves is also in a footnote:

    "There is a pain — so utter —
    It swallows substance up —
    Then covers the Abyss with Trance —
    So Memory can step
    Around — across — upon it —
    As one within a Swoon —
    Goes safely — where an open eye —
    Would drop Him — Bone by Bone -"

 
I really connected with it, and bent it to shape the turmoil I was going through at the time, actively denying the fatality of my then-relationship through infatuation. 

    "Cover the abyss
    With a trance of madness, 
    So my careful heart 
    can manage 
    a safe way around it" 

The verse's pathos is similar to one of my favorite Bojack Horseman quotes, "When you wear rose colored glasses, all of the red flags just look like flags."
