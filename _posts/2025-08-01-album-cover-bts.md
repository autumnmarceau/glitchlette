## The Photoshoot That Almost Ended in Disaster: An **EVERY RAT** Horror Story


So, back in February my creative director Jaz convinced me to go to Long Beach, WA for a photoshoot. All we had prepared was the outfit, some fake blood and a few locations. I know Jaz had a vision, but I was pretty much just along for the ride. 

## Dear David Lynch: I Get It Now

The journey from Long Beach to Seattle is about 3 and a half hours. Once you get off I-5, the landscape begins to exhale the iconic eerieness of rural Washington. Winding road lead you through misty lowlands, old growth forests, and drowsy logging towns that seem to straddle the seam of here and *there*. It's easy to see why David Lynch chose this kind of place for *Twin Peaks.* 

One such town, Montesano, was where we stopped for gas, an unassuming Chevron adjacent to a small, even more unassuming shopping complex. The concrete buildings felt especially unnatural among the  verdant disquet of the hillside, as if they weren't meant to be there and you weren't meant to see them. 

Across from the gas station was a small consignment shop, with no signage or branding but a big "OPEN" sign. We'd been wanting to find some sort of weapon or prop for the shoot, so we thought we'd take a look before we got back on the road. 

## The Axe from The Shop With No Name

Inside, was only what I could describe as a shrine. Old dolls lined shelves across from gun racks. A recycled refridgerator box laid sideways housed a *pit* of antlers and animal bones, serving as overflow for the dozens that hung from the ceiling. Tetanus was a constant threat, with rusty chainsaws and garden tools from various centuries enclosing the narrow aisles. Walls not used for weapons display were affixed with a combination of the rare and mundane.  vintage Elvis figurines next to singing fish. 

In the weapons and tools was what I would lovingly describe as an *abundant* selection of axes, placed on the floor and verticaly leaning against the wall, like a domino game of mini-guillotines ready to fall lest you step incorrectly. There was one that drew my eye, with a bright red head, sturdy handle and a suitable amount of wear and tear for authenticity. 

We checked out, while making casual conversation with the elderly married couple who owned the place. They seemed like an ordinary couple, only eccentric by way of being completely unaware of the gonzo shopping experience they offered. 

They were *very* excited I was buying the axe, telling me how it was new to their inventory, having just been brought in a few days prior by "some guy". I ended up buying a sticker that said "BIG FOOT IS REAL AND I HELPED HIM COMMIT TAX FRAUD" that I popped on my laptop. (Maybe you'll see it at the next [show?](/shows))

 We mentioned that tomorrow we would be heading back through town  on our way home and they encouraged us to stop by. The woman laughed as she handed me the receipt. "Our business name isn't even on here!"

As we pulled away, I opened Google Maps to mark the spot so we could return tomorrow. 

We ended up naming the axe Shelley (after Shelley Duvall, of course. RIP <3).

## The Shoot at Long Beach

Once we got to Long Beach, we checked into our hotel and prepped for the shoot while we waited for it to get dark. We started outside Marsh’s Free Museum, home to [Jake the Alligator Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_the_Alligator_Man). Marsh's was half the reason we came to Long Beach, because their outdoor lighting used to be a mix of candy-colored LEDs and neon signs, but in recent years they must have dialed back. Still, we got some cool shots, but we were eager for the big event of the evening: shooting on the beach. 

Long Beach is cool because in the winter, you're allowed to drive directly onto the sand. So we did, parking about 50 feet from the shore. The shoot itself was a mix of fun and totally miserable due to how little clothing I was wearing. Our only light sources were the car’s headlights and a tiny 6x3-inch lightbox Jaz brought along.

In between takes, I huddled in that ghost hoodie to stay warm, which is how we got the thumbnail photo.

The weather was *awful*. Low 40s, windy, raining sideways. My weather app showed a **gale warning** advisory, but we figured we could ignore it since we weren’t getting in the water. Bad call.

Most of the photos were unusable—I just looked cold and miserable. I could barely see due to my non-prescription sclera lenses.  

## Never Turn Your Back On The Ocean

After the shoot, we got back in the car and I tried my best to talk through labored exhales and chattering teeth. I put my glasses on, finally able to see clearly for the first time in hours, and looked ahead.

 “Hey, is it just me or is the water getting closer?”

It was.

*Very fast.*

As the wall of water rushed towards us, I yelled “GO GO GO GO GO." Jaz cranked the car into reverse, slammed the gas and flipped a u, speeding away from the incoming wave *just in time.* 

We didn't stop to look back, heading straight for the hotel, erupting into maniacal, adrenaline-fueled laughter once we entered our room. I opened the weather app again to re-check the gale warning… and saw something I had missed before:

 **SLEEPER WAVE WARNING**

Whoops. My bad. 

### What is a Sleeper Wave?
> **A sleeper wave** (aka a sneaker wave) is an unexpectedly large and powerful ocean wave that can appear without warning, even on an otherwise calm beach. Unlike regular waves that follow a predictable pattern, sleeper waves can surge much farther up the shore, catching beachgoers off guard.

### The Danger of Sleeper Waves
> - *Surprise Factor:* These waves can come out of nowhere, making them particularly dangerous. People relaxing on the beach or wading in shallow water might not see them coming. **NEVER TURN YOUR BACK TO THE OCEAN.**
> - *Powerful Force:* Sleeper waves have a strong force that can knock you over and pull you into the ocean, leading to potentially dangerous situations like being injured by rocks and debris or drowning.
> - *Unpredictability:* It’s impossible to predict when or where a sleeper wave might hit, which adds to the risk.

Quick research showed it only takes a few inches of water to make a car float. So when I say it was a near-death experience, I MEAN IT, y’all. 

Neither of us slept that night. Since then, we’ve developed a healthy fear *and* reverent fascination with the ocean. She’s our God now. She let us live. Honestly, I should probably dedicate the album to her.

## The Uncanny Mystery of Shelley the Axe

On our way back, we followed through on our promise to the old couple and stopped at the same Chevron for gas, hoping to see what else we could find at the Shop with No Name. 

They shop was closed, blinds pulled, obscuring what was or wasn't inside. I pulled up the pin I'd dropped on Google Maps. 

I could not find any record of that business existing. 

All that being said, we're pretty sure Shelley is haunted, but whether the poltergeist protected us or plotted our demise has yet to be determined. Still, we keep her around, just in case.

  <br><figcaption>Totally worth it. That photo is unsettling as fuck, which was the goal.</figcaption>
</figure>

In the end, despite the strange occurences and nearly shuffling off this mortal coil, the final result was better than I had imagined. My goal was vague but rooted in one pathos: the final girl becomes the villain, and I think we nailed it. 

**ALL HAIL THE OCEAN. ALL HAIL SHELLEY THE AXE**
