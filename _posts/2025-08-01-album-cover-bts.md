What started as a hot girl photo shoot almost ended with DEATH AND DISASTER! 

So, back in February my creative director Jaz convinced me to go to Long Beach, WA for a photoshoot. All we had prepared was the outfit, some fake blood and a few locations. I'm know Jaz had a vision, but I was pretty much just along for the ride. 

The journey from Long Beach to Seattle is about 3 and a half hours. Once you get off I-5, the vibe shifts. The road begins to wind through misty lowlands, old growth forests, logging towns that feel just beyond the veil. The drive encapsulated that particular eeriness that seems to hang over so much of rural Washington.  It was easy to see why David Lynch chose this kind of place for *Twin Peaks.* 

We stopped inMontesano, WA for gas, pulling into a Chevron and an adjacent small shopping complex. 
Across from the gas station was small consignment shop, with no signage but a big "OPEN" sign. We'd been wanting to find some sort of weapon or prop for me for the shoot, so we thought we'd take a look before we got back on the road. 

The shop was a shrine to weird antqiues and used tools. They had everything from old dolls, vintage chainsaws, antique guns, and *axes*. 

There was one that drew my eye. A bright red head, sturdy handle and a suitable amount of wear and tear, for authenticity. 

We checked out, making casual conversation with the elderly married couple who owned the place. They were *very* excited I was buying the axe, telling me how it was new to their inventory, having just been brought in a few days prior. We mentioned that we would be heading back through tomorrow on our way home and they encouraged us to stop by. The woman laughed as she handed me the receipt. "Our business name isn't even on here!"

As we pulled away, I opened google maps to mark the spot so we could return tomorrow. 

I could not find any record of that business existing. 

We ended up naming the axe Shelley (after Shelley Duvall, of course. RIP <3).

  <br><figcaption>Not sure how she would feel about us naming the axe after her, though at least it wasn’t a baseball bat. Kubrick made her swing one in The Shining for 127 takes straight. Deep-cut trivia for the horror nerds out there.</figcaption>

Once we got to Long Beach, we checked into our hotel and prepped for the shoot while we waited for it to get dark. We started outside Marsh’s Free Museum, home to [Jake the Alligator Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_the_Alligator_Man). Marsh's was half the reason we came to Long Beach, because their outdoor lighting used to be a mix of candy-colored LEDs and neon signs, but in recent years they must have dialed back. Still, we got some cool shots, but we were eager for the big event of the evening: shooting on the beach. 

Long Beach is cool because in the winter, you're allowed to drive directly onto the sand. So we did, parking about 50 feet from the shore. The shoot itself was a mix of fun and totally miserable due to how little clothing I was wearing. Our only light sources were the car’s headlights and a tiny 6x3-inch lightbox Jaz brought along.

In between takes, I huddled in Jaz’s ghost hoodie to stay warm, which is how we got the thumbnail photo.

The weather was *awful*. Low 40s, windy, raining sideways. My weather app showed a **gale warning** advisory, but we figured we could ignore it since we weren’t getting in the water. Bad call.

Most of the photos were unusable—I just looked cold and miserable. I could barely see due to my non-prescription sclera lenses.  

After the shoot, we got back in the car and took a deep breath. I put my glasses on, finally able to see clearly for the first time in hours, and looked ahead.

I said to Jaz, “Hey, is it just me or is the water getting closer?”

It was.

*Very fast.*

As the wall of water rushed towards us, I yelled “GO GO GO GO GO." Jaz cranked the car into reverse, slammed the gas and flipped the car around, speeding away from the incoming wave *just in time.* 
We didn't stop to look back, heading straight for the hotel, erupting into maniacal, adrenaline-fueld laughter once we entered our room. I opened the weather app again to re-check the gale warning… and saw something I had missed before:

 **SLEEPER WAVE WARNING**

 If you aren't aware, 

 
> **A sleeper wave** (aka a sneaker wave) is an unexpectedly large and powerful ocean wave that can appear without warning, even on an otherwise calm beach. Unlike regular waves that follow a predictable pattern, sleeper waves can surge much farther up the shore, catching beachgoers off guard.
>
> **The Danger of Sleeper Waves**
>
> - *Surprise Factor:* These waves can come out of nowhere, making them particularly dangerous. People relaxing on the beach or wading in shallow water might not see them coming. **NEVER TURN YOUR BACK TO THE OCEAN.**
> - *Powerful Force:* Sleeper waves have a strong force that can knock you over and pull you into the ocean, leading to potentially dangerous situations like being injured by rocks and debris or drowning.
> - *Unpredictability:* It’s impossible to predict when or where a sleeper wave might hit, which adds to the risk.



Quick research showed it only takes a few inches of water to make a car float. So when I say it was a near-death experience, I MEAN IT, y’all. 

Neither of us slept that night. Since then, we’ve developed a fear *and* fascination with the ocean. She’s our God now. She let us live. Honestly, I should probably dedicate the album to her.

  <br><figcaption>Totally worth it. That photo is unsettling as fuck, which was the goal.</figcaption>

As for Shelley, we're convinced its haunted, but whether the poltergeist protected us or plotted our demise has yet to be determined. Still, we keep her around, just in case. 

Have you had a near death experience? I'd love to hear about it, [let's commiserate!](https://glitchlette.com/guestbook)
