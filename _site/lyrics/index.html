  const lyrics = `
Nor yet no vain wraiths nor quiet ghosts
constrained Thy chariot to go backward
Such as that, they say, in diverse places
The wraiths walk of ghosts dying or dead

There I stayed
Look what I have left

Inuman in unison
Heretics with arrogance
Forks between our chests and chin
Diagrams with evidence

There I stayed
Look what I have left

I don't wanna miss you

She was a forest fire
a single embered spark out of control
The toxic heat
it seeped into
the hollow yearning walls

it left this place empty
it left me empty
she left empty

you are a windstorm
from the inside out
you purged this house
foundation rattled and cried out
This is how I write a love song

I write a love song
She left me empty
You always fill me
They leave me empty
You always fill me
But can you feel me?
Will you leave me empty?

I don't wanna miss you

Cover the abyss
With a trance of madness
So my careful heart can manage
A safe way around it

I only hear the...

Cling to what you said
Tangled in my bed
I plead and repent
Fuckin innocent

I only hear the
Crying in my head
Who is listening?
Mental dissonance
Fuckin innocent

I feel I have to
Cling to what you said
Tangled in my bed
I plead and repent
Fuckin innocent

I only hear the
Crying in my head
Who is listening?
Mental dissonance
Fuckin innocent

I only hear her

I'm in over my head
Flashing lights crash through the window you are under
with your head cradled like sand in my hands

Are you crying?
Should I worry?
I know I can be the things that you can't
Are you sleeping?
Did you hear me?
Wish you would give me the things that you can't

Cradled like sand in my hands

When I'm in love
I let it consume me
Pour it and fill every cell in my body
With fire they crumble to ash
when it leaves me
So much to grieve when you leave

When I want love
I let it consume me
Pour it and fill every hole in my psyche
With first they crumble to ash
When you leave me

So much to grieve when she leaves
So much to grieve when you leaves

I could try to say
What festered in my brain
As you float in and out of sleep
I spill the words

And you say nothing
As you always do

I still hear your voice

What about time?
What about tears?
What about living through every year?
You know all about me
Now I can't forget you

Wish that I could say
That I cried while we putrified
As the blood smeared around my face
I started to smile
And I feel nothing
As I've always wished to

What about time?
what about tears?
What about living through all the years?
You knew all about me
Now I can't forgive you
What about time?
What about tears?
What about living through every year?
You knew all about me
Now I can't forget you

I wish I could say in the night what came
Running through my head
Rotting in our bed
I wish I could say in the night what came
Rotting in our bed
Running through my head
I wish I could say

What about time?
What about tears?
What about living through every year?
You knew all about me
Now I can't forget you
What about time?
what about tears?
What about living through every year?
You knew all about me
Now I can't forgive you
What about time?
What about tears?
What about living through every year?
You knew everything about me
Now I can't forgive you
What about time?
what about tears?
What about living through every year?
You knew all about me
Now I can't forget you

I feel wasted baby
Devoured me like cheap wine
Am I wasted yet baby
Draw your hands away
when I reach with mine

I think its more painful this way
To be so far outside the blame
Nothing I could or change
To fix the way you

Played your games
With my heart so reckless
I've been foolish, darling
But you played into it
about

	
I can't sleep another night away from you

Close my eyes and all I see is where I am supposed to be

I shouldn't even be here
at least that's what it felt like
nineteen, breathing green
crystalized within a dream
tripping to the street lights

wasted at my Nan's house
how'd the hell i get here
fading to the echoes
peeling off the wall's veneer

oh wow so mature analyze and reassure
to be young is to be careless
whiskey soaking your velour
sleeping on a stranger's floor

Lie and you lie and you lie and you realize
i have no words for what I'm trying to say to you
We live and we lie in our youth

And I can't even see straight
but babe why would i want to
heat is building in my bones
and i wanna be alone now

Oh wow so mature
analyze and reassure
to be young it to be careless
whiskey soaking your velour
sleeping on a stranger's floor

Lie and you lie and you lie and you realize
i have no words for what I'm trying to say to you
We live and we lie in our youth

I can't forget the faces I have seen
Crystalized visions lost within a dream

Lie and you lie and you lie and you realize
i have no words for what I'm trying to say to you
We live and we lie in our youth

This ice has thawed from all the embers
of the flame that we had smothered
I had to melt myself a la auto-sarcophagy
But if I'm lucky I'll freeze

When I'm with you I don't feel human
More like a god that's seen the light
I can't wait for you to come home
At the end of every day
Much like they wait for the sun

You make me want to live
You made me human

Thought it was broke
But it was froze
And you melted me down
Icicles have gone and pierced my heart

You make me want to live
You made me human

this heart will exhume itself
consume itself
resume itself

we were the whispered words
of a hymn so soft and cold
a beckoning broken vow untold
now you are the shroud I wear
to deny it all

Well was it worth it for you?
You gave it all
(You are the shroud I wear to deny everything we had but it dies with me)

On the phone your speech it was slurred
With every bottle we promised to drink
That cackling echo it shackled my ego
And bound that night to my brain

Now every reverie is fused with you
and every shroud i'll wear

Well was it worth it for you?
You gave it all
(You are the shroud I wear to deny everything we had but it dies with me)
(This heart will exhume itself, consume itself, resume itself)

All I wanted was to heal and to hold you
All I wanted was to peel and unfold
but you let go

Part of me hopes if we keep playing this game
That you will change your mind
This mangled heart you've broken
between my lungs will heal just fine
You'll never know my love

Part of me hopes if we keep playing this game
That you will change your mind
(why would you leave me)
This mangled heart you've broken
between my lungs will heal just fine
(why would you leave me)
You'll never know my love
(why would leave me)

All i wanted was to heal and to hold you
All I wanted was to peel and unfold
But you let go

Baby hide me somewhere they can't follow
(I'll always love you)
I will soundly sleep between your teeth
(I'll never hurt you)
Bury all these dusted bones somewhere hollow
(I won't forget you)
I'll stay silent here and weep beneath
(You know that I do)

YEAH
YEAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!

Bitch!
