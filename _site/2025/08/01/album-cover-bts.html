    <p>What started as a hot girl photo shoot almost ended with DEATH AND DISASTER!</p>

<p>So, back in February my creative director Jaz convinced me to go to Long Beach, WA for a photoshoot. All we had prepared was the outfit and some fake blood. I’m sure Jaz had a vision, but I was pretty much just along for the ride.</p>

<p>On our way there, we stopped at a random consignment shop with no name or signage. Inside, we found the axe you see in the photo. The guy who sold it to us told us it had just been brought in and was super old. We named it Shelley (after Shelley Duvall, of course. RIP &lt;3).</p>

  <br /><figcaption>Not sure how Shelley Duvall would feel about us naming the axe after her, but at least it wasn’t a baseball bat. That’s a deep-cut reference for the nerds out there.</figcaption>

<p>Once we got to Long Beach, we checked into our hotel and prepped for the shoot while we waited for it to get dark. We started outside Marsh’s Free Museum, home to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_the_Alligator_Man">Jake the Alligator Man</a>. Then it was time for the <em>real</em> shoot—on the beach.</p>

<p>Long Beach is cool because in the winter, you’re allowed to drive directly onto the sand. So we did, parking about 50 feet from the shore. The shoot itself was a mix of fun and totally miserable due to how little clothing I was wearing. Our only light sources were the car’s headlights and a tiny 6x3-inch lightbox Jaz brought along.</p>

<p>In between takes, I huddled in Jaz’s ghost hoodie to stay warm, which is how we got the thumbnail photo.</p>

<p>The weather was <em>awful</em>. Low 40s, windy, raining sideways. My weather app had given us a <strong>gale warning</strong>, but we figured we could ignore it since we weren’t getting in the water. Bad call.</p>

<p>Most of the photos were unusable—I just looked cold and miserable. I was also wearing sclera lenses, and since I normally wear prescription contacts, I could barely see anything.</p>

<p>After the shoot, we got back in the car and took a deep breath. I put my glasses on and looked ahead.</p>

<p>I said to Jaz, “Hey, is it just me or is the water getting closer?”</p>

<p>It was.</p>

<p><em>Very fast.</em></p>

<p>I yelled “GO GO GO GO GO” and Jaz pulled off some secret-agent J-turn maneuver and got us out <em>just</em> in time.</p>

<p>Back at the hotel, we were hysterical—adrenaline surging, manically laughing at our close call. I opened the weather app again to re-check the gale warning… and saw something I had missed before:</p>

<p><strong>SLEEPER WAVE WARNING</strong></p>

<p>If you aren’t aware,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A sleeper wave</strong> (aka a sneaker wave) is an unexpectedly large and powerful ocean wave that can appear without warning, even on an otherwise calm beach. Unlike regular waves that follow a predictable pattern, sleeper waves can surge much farther up the shore, catching beachgoers off guard.</p>

  <p><strong>The Danger of Sleeper Waves</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Surprise Factor:</em> These waves can come out of nowhere, making them particularly dangerous. People relaxing on the beach or wading in shallow water might not see them coming. <strong>NEVER TURN YOUR BACK TO THE OCEAN.</strong></li>
    <li><em>Powerful Force:</em> Sleeper waves have a strong force that can knock you over and pull you into the ocean, leading to potentially dangerous situations like being injured by rocks and debris or drowning.</li>
    <li><em>Unpredictability:</em> It’s impossible to predict when or where a sleeper wave might hit, which adds to the risk.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Quick research showed it only takes a few inches of water to make a car float. So when I say it was a near-death experience, I MEAN IT, y’all.</p>

<p>Neither of us slept that night. Since then, we’ve developed a fear <em>and</em> fascination with the ocean. She’s our God now. She let us live. Honestly, I should probably dedicate the album to her.</p>

  <br /><figcaption>Totally worth it. That photo is unsettling as fuck, which was the goal.</figcaption>

<p>Have you had a near death experience? I’d love to hear about it, <a href="https://glitchlette.com/guestbook">let’s commiserate!</a>
