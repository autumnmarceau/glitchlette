    <p>This is the story of how my creative director Jaz and I took the album cover photo for the latest GLITCHLETTE EP <a href="/music">EVERY RAY WANTS TO CRAWL IN YOUR MOUTH AND CLEAN YOUR TEETH!</a>, and how we almost didn’t live to tell the tale.</p>

<h2 id="dear-david-lynch-i-get-it-now">Dear David Lynch: I Get It Now</h2>

<p>Back in February, Jaz and I drove to Long Beach, WA for a photo shoot. The journey from Seattle is about 3 and a half hours, and once you get off I-5, the landscape begins to exhale the iconic eeriness of rural Washington. Winding roads lead you through misty lowlands, old growth forests, and drowsy logging towns that toe the seam of here and <em>there</em>. It’s easy to see why David Lynch chose this kind of place for <em>Twin Peaks.</em> Here it feels like every tree portends your doom.</p>

<p>One such town, Montesano, was where we stopped for gas, an unassuming Chevron adjacent to a small, even more unassuming shopping complex. The concrete buildings felt especially unnatural among the verdant stillness of the hillside, as if they weren’t meant to be there and  <em>you</em> certainly weren’t meant to see them.</p>

<p>Across from the gas station was a small consignment shop, with no signage or branding but a big “OPEN” sign. We’d been wanting to find some sort of weapon or prop for the shoot, so we thought we’d take a look before we got back on the road.</p>

<h2 id="the-axe-from-the-shop-with-no-name">The Axe from The Shop With No Name</h2>

<p>Inside was a hazardous shrine to chaos. Old dolls whose barren eyes stared blankly across from gun racks. A sideways refrigerator box housed a <em>pit</em> of antlers and animal bones, serving as overflow for the dozens that hung from the ceiling. Tetanus was a constant threat, with rusty chainsaws and garden tools from various centuries enclosing the narrow aisles. Any remaining wall space not used for product display was filled with a mix of the rare and mundane.Coca Vintage Elvis figurines next to singing fish.</p>

<p>Among the weapons and tools was what I would lovingly describe as an <em>abundant</em> selection of axes,  hazardously propped against the wall, blades out, like a domino line of mini-guillotines for those with misguided steps. There was one that drew my eye, with a bright red head, sturdy handle and a suitable amount of wear and tear for authenticity.</p>

<p>We checked out, while making casual conversation with the elderly married couple who owned the place. They seemed like an ordinary couple, only eccentric by way of being completely unaware of the gonzo shopping experience they curated.</p>

<p>They were <em>very</em> excited I was buying the axe, telling me how it was new to their inventory, having just been brought in a few days prior by ‘some guy’. I ended up buying a sticker that said “BIG FOOT IS REAL AND I HELPED HIM COMMIT TAX FRAUD” that I popped on my laptop. (Maybe you’ll see it at the next <a href="/shows">show?</a>)</p>

<p>We mentioned we’d be passing through town again the next day and they encouraged us to stop by. The woman laughed as she handed me the receipt. “Our business name isn’t even on here!”</p>

<p>As we pulled away, I opened Google Maps to mark the spot so we could return tomorrow.</p>

<p>We ended up naming the axe Shelley (after Shelley Duvall, of course. RIP &lt;3).</p>

  <br /><figcaption>Not sure how she would feel about us naming the axe after her, though at least it wasn’t a baseball bat. Kubrick made her swing one in The Shining for 127 takes in a row. Deep-cut trivia for the horror nerds out there.</figcaption>

<h2 id="the-shoot-at-long-beach">The Shoot at Long Beach</h2>

<p>Once we got to Long Beach, we checked into our hotel and prepped for the shoot while we waited for it to get dark. We started outside Marsh’s Free Museum, home to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_the_Alligator_Man">Jake the Alligator Man</a>. Marsh’s was half the reason we came to Long Beach, because their outdoor lighting used to be a mix of candy-colored LEDs and neon signs, but in recent years they must have dialed back. Still, we got some cool shots, but we were eager for the big event of the evening: shooting on <em>the</em> beach.</p>

<p>Long Beach is cool because in the winter, you’re allowed to drive directly onto the sand. So we did, parking about 50 feet from the shore. The shoot itself was a mix of fun and totally miserable due to how little clothing I was wearing. Our only light sources were the car’s headlights and a tiny 6x3-inch lightbox Jaz brought along.</p>

<p>In between takes, I huddled in the ghost hoodie to stay warm, which is how we got the thumbnail photo.</p>

  <br /><figcaption>If you zoom in, you can see how the rain fell sideways in this photo.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The weather was <em>awful</em>. Low 40s, windy, raining sideways. My weather app showed a <strong>gale warning</strong> advisory, but we figured we could ignore it since we weren’t getting in the water. Bad call.</p>

<p>Most of the photos were unusable—I just looked cold and miserable. I could barely see due to my non-prescription sclera lenses.</p>

<h2 id="never-turn-your-back-on-the-ocean">Never Turn Your Back On The Ocean</h2>

<p>After the shoot, we got back in the car and I tried my best to talk through labored exhales and chattering teeth. I put my glasses on, finally able to see clearly for the first time in hours, and looked ahead.</p>

<p>#### “Hey, is it just me or is the water getting closer?”</p>

<p>It was.</p>

<p><em>Very fast.</em></p>

<p>As the wall of water rushed towards us, I yelled “GO GO GO GO GO.” Jaz cranked the car into reverse, slammed the gas and flipped a U, speeding away from the incoming wave <em>just in time.</em></p>

<p>We didn’t stop to look back, heading straight for the hotel, erupting into maniacal, adrenaline-fueled laughter once we entered our room. I opened the weather app again to re-check the gale warning… and saw something I had missed before:</p>

<p>#### SLEEPER WAVE WARNING!</p>

<p>Whoops. My bad.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-sleeper-wave">What is a Sleeper Wave?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sleeper waves</strong> (aka a sneaker wave) are potentially deadly waves that surge further up the beach than expected, overtaking the unaware.&gt;- Beach goers can be swept into the ocean.</li>
    <li>This can result in cold water immersion.</li>
    <li>Cold water immersion can be dangerous, even deadly.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-danger-of-sleeper-waves">The Danger of Sleeper Waves</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Stay farther back from the ocean than you think is necessary. Sneaker waves can run up the beach by at least 150 feet (45 meters) into the dry beach.</li>
    <li><strong>Never turn your back on the ocean.</strong></li>
    <li>Be aware of the following dangers:.</li>
    <li>The force and speed with which sneaker waves move.</li>
    <li>No place on the beach is too high for the wave to reach.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Quick research showed it only takes a few inches of water to make a car float. The totality of what we had narrowly avoided began to sink in.</p>

<h4 id="these-photos-better-be-damn-good">“These photos better be damn good!”</h4>

<p>Neither of us slept that night. Since then, we’ve developed a healthy fear <em>and</em> reverent fascination with the ocean. She’s our God now. She let us live. Honestly, I should probably dedicate the album to her.</p>

<h2 id="the-uncanny-mystery-of-shelley-the-axe">The Uncanny Mystery of Shelley the Axe</h2>

<p>On our way back, we followed through on our promise to the old couple and stopped at the same Chevron for gas, hoping to see what else we could find at the Shop with No Name.</p>

<p>The shop was closed, blinds pulled, obscuring what was or wasn’t inside. I pulled up the pin I’d dropped on Google Maps.</p>

<p>I could not find any record of that business existing.</p>

<p>All that being said, we’re pretty sure Shelley is haunted, but whether the poltergeist plotted our demise or protected us from it is TBD. Still, we keep her around, just in case.</p>

<h2 id="was-it-worth-it-for-you">Was It Worth It <a href="https://glitchlette.bandcamp.com/track/shroud">for you?</a></h2>

<figure>
  <img src="/photos/EVERYRAT_OG.jpg" alt="GLITCHLETTE's Every Rat album cover" class="blog-post-image" />
  <br /><figcaption>Totally worth it. That photo is unsettling as fuck, which was the goal.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the end, despite the strange occurrences and nearly shuffling off this mortal coil, the final result was better than I had imagined. My goal was vague but rooted in one murky vision: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_girl">final girl</a> becomes the killer, and I think we nailed it.</p>

<p><strong>ALL HAIL THE OCEAN. ALL HAIL SHELLEY THE AXE</strong></p>
